# Enoch
Those are what I use often to build my projects and clients without needing CMS. What's in the package are basic responsive website template with PHP, Bourbon and Neat.

# Docs
 * `header.php` Contains all of the repeatable HTML that belongs in the header
 * `index.php` Main page which calls in the header and footer
 * `footer.php` Contains all of the repeatable HTML that belongs in the footer
 * `scss` folder includes bourbon, neat and custom folders (normalize, etc.) that compiled to `css` folder.
 * `favicons.psd` HTML5 boilerplate favicon photoshop template
 
# How to use it
If you're already familiar with compilers like [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) or [Koala](http://koala-app.com/) then you're on the right track. If not, check them out. To compile, select the `base.scss` file and set the output path to `css/base.css`. I used [MAMP Pro](http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/) that allowed me to test and modify PHP files locally. I used `favicons.psd` to update the favicon only once. Pretty nifty, eh?
